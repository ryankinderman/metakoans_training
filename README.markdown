# Training on Ruby Meta-programming with MetaKoans

I've been asked a few times by clients to give Ruby meta-programming training to other developers. The first time that this happened, I was lucky to stumble upon [RubyQuiz #67 - metakoans.rb](http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html).

After using MetaKoans as a training tool for the first time, I realized that, while it was great for helping people to learn Ruby meta-programming, it didn't lend itself as easily as it could to being solved in an incremental fashion. For details on this, see my [blog article](http://kinderman.net/articles/2007/09/22/learning-ruby-meta-programming-with-metakoans) on the topic.

I've rewritten the koans so that the solution can be developed more incrementally, and have saved the knowledge permutations that I made for each koan, to prove that the problem can be solved in a stepwise fashion.

If you're looking to learn Ruby meta-programming, don't look at my knowledge files!
